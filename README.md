# spotify_history_dashboard_project
This project explores my Spotify listening history dataset with nearly 143k records. It includes track metadata, listening duration, playback reasons, platform usage, and temporal listening behavior. The dataset is ideal for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization projects.
