# Spotify Listening History Analysis

##  Project Overview
This project contains my Spotify listening history, spanning 142,978 records.  
It captures detailed insights about my music consumption habits, including track metadata, listening duration, platforms, playback reasons, and temporal features (day, month, year).

The dataset is provided in CSV format and is suitable for:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data visualization (listening patterns, top artists, etc.)
- Machine learning projects (recommendation systems, skip prediction, etc.)
